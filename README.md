# wild-linq


## Objective:
You will create a program that accounts for protected species around the world.

There are three species that we are looking to protect:

    White cougars - There are 3 remaining
    White tigers - There are 100 remaining
    Albino turtles - There are 15 remaining

Validation Criteria

    The program displays the number of animals recorded for each species in the console.
    An Animal entity represents an animal. The animal belongs to only one species.
    A Species entity represents a species of animal.
    LINQ methods are used to count the animals.
